[ This is an updated version of the page formerly at
`www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/`, before that at
`http://reality.sgi.com/boehm/gc.html` and before that at
`ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/gc/gc.html`. ]

The
[Boehm](http://www.hboehm.info)-[Demers](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/annual_report/00-01/bios.htm#demers)-[Weiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser)
conservative Garbage Collector (**BDWGC**) can be used as a garbage collecting
replacement for C `malloc` or C++ `new`. It allows you to allocate memory
basically as you normally would, without explicitly deallocating memory that
is no longer useful. The collector automatically recycles memory when
it determines that it can no longer be otherwise accessed. A simple example
of such a use is given [here](simple_example.md).

The collector is also used by a number of programming language implementations
that either use C as intermediate code, want to facilitate easier
interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the simple collector
interface. For a more detailed description of the interface, see
[here](gcinterface.md).

Alternatively, the garbage collector may be used as a [leak detector](leak.md)
for C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.

Typically several versions are offered for
[downloading](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/wiki/Download): preview, stable,
legacy. Usually you should use the one marked as the _latest stable_ release.
Preview versions may contain additional features, platform support, but are
likely to be less well tested. The list of changes for each version
is specified on the [releases](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc/releases) page.
The development version (snapshot) is available in the master branch of
[bdwgc git](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc) repository on GitHub.

The arguments for and against conservative garbage collection in C and C++ are
briefly discussed [here](http://www.hboehm.info/gc/issues.html).

Empirically, this collector works with most unmodified C programs, simply
by replacing `malloc` and `calloc` with `GC_malloc` calls, replacing `realloc`
with `GC_realloc` calls, and removing `free` calls. Exceptions are discussed
[here](http://www.hboehm.info/gc/issues.html).

## Platforms

The collector is not completely portable, but the distribution includes ports
to most standard PC and UNIX/Linux platforms. The collector should work
on Linux, Android, BSD variants, OS/2, Windows (Win32 and Win64), MacOS X,
iOS, HP/UX, Solaris, Tru64, Irix, Symbian and other operating systems. Some
platforms are more polished (better supported) than others.

Irix pthreads, Linux threads, Windows threads, Solaris threads (pthreads
only), HP/UX 11 pthreads, Tru64 pthreads, and MacOS X threads are supported.

See also [here](porting.md) for the instructions on how to port the library to
new platforms.

## Some Collector Details

The collector uses a [mark-sweep](http://www.hboehm.info/gc/complexity.html)
algorithm. It provides incremental and generational collection under operating
systems which provide the right kind of virtual memory support. (Currently
this includes SunOS[45], IRIX, OSF/1, Linux, and Windows, with varying
restrictions.) It allows [finalization](finalization.md) code to be invoked
when an object is collected. It can take advantage of type information
to locate pointers if such information is provided, but it is usually used
without such information. See the README and `gc.h` files in the distribution
for more details.

For an overview of the implementation, see [here](gcdescr.md).

The garbage collector distribution includes a C string (`cord.h`) package that
provides for fast concatenation and substring operations on long strings.
A simple curses- and Windows-based editor that represents the entire file as
a cord is included as a sample application.  See [cords.md](cords.md)
file for the details.

Performance of the non-incremental collector is typically competitive with
`malloc`/`free` implementations. Both space and time overhead are likely to be
only slightly higher for programs written for `malloc`/`free` (see Detlefs,
Dosser and Zorn's
[Memory Allocation Costs in Large C and C++ Programs](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Memory-allocation-costs-in-large-C-and-C%2B%2B-programs-Detlefs-Dosser/49b2b2cec4ce52493c031d964fb3be31d1e02b77)).
For programs allocating primarily very small objects, the collector may be
faster; for programs allocating primarily large objects it will be slower.
If the collector is used in a multi-threaded environment and configured for
thread-local allocation, it may in some cases significantly outperform
`malloc`/`free` allocation in time.

We also expect that in many cases any additional overhead will be more than
compensated for by e.g. decreased copying if programs are written and tuned
for garbage collection.
